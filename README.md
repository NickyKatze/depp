# DEPP - Dumb and Easy Project Placer

If you're anything like me, you are probably coding a lot of little projects and every time you have to start a new one you're asking yourself: how was that again? Then you go to recent projects to look up that specific thing you've been wondering how you did. Yeah, I feel you.

So here I am automating stuff.

**DISCLAMER** this project is likely to be very specific and undermaintained, so feel free to fork and adapt to your own needs.

> 'Automating' comes from the roots 'auto-' meaning 'self-', and 'mating', meaning 'screwing'.

## Idea

Write a bash script that, when run, will create a directory of specified name and copy some project specific files into it. And maybe, someday, do a `git init` or whatnot.

## Usage

You know how to run `.sh`, right?
